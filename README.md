Vibe coded Swedish and Danish Library and Archive vocabulary app.

The app was coded by prompting Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Canvas with the prompt "create a duolingo like app to learn swedish and danish library and archive related vocabulary" - the operation of the app was refined from there.

Notes:
* Initally, the app had only had 20 questions, I prompted it to add another 80
* The default way it set up the user interface was a bit strange, so some further prompts were needed to simplify it
* When I asked how to put the app on Github it started telling me about setting up a local React development environment. I didn't want to do that so asked it to just generate a simple HTML file instead, which it did
* The web page for the app did not scroll by default, making it unusable on mobile browsers. I got Gemini to fix this.
* The name of the app was suggested by Gemini after I asked it to come up with a list of names
* Creating an app that worked to my satisfaction took about 30-40 minutes.
* I haven't checked the translations!
